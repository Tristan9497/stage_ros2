## Thanks
I like to thank all people behind [Stage](https://github.com/rtv/Stage) and [ros-simulation/stage_ros](https://github.com/ros-simulation) for the simulation and the first ROS bridge as well as the people for the initial ROS2 implementations [ShengliangD/stage_ros2](https://github.com/ShengliangD/stage_ros2) and [n0nzzz/stage_ros2](https://github.com/n0nzzz/stage_ros2). 
The work was used as base for my implemenation. Which differs to the previos ROS interfaces in its modularity.
